        <p>Hello. My name is Vuyo Faleni and I am from East London, South Africa. It is a
            small city on the coast, I enjoy sitting by the beach and watching the waves
            in my spare time because I find it calming. I also enjoy reading and baking.
            I am currently studying Web developent. I am thrilled to be learning something
            new and to broaden my horizons in tech.
